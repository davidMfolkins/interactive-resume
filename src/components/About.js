      <h1>Hi! My name is David Folkins, and I'm a fresh full-stack developer from Montréal, Canada.</h1>
      <p>
        In April 2020, I was laid off from my job as a QA Associate. 
        Living in Canada I was lucky enough to keep afloat with the CERB program, but I wanted to make a change.
        I had always dreamt of becoming a developer, and with the support of my fiancé, family and friends, I took the opportunity to make that happen. 
        I spent the next 5 months teaching myself as much HTML, CSS and Javascript as possible before finally joining Lighthouse Labs Remote Web Development Course.
        Over 3 months later I would graduate, and land my first role as a full-stack developer in February 2021 at 4th Whale Marketing.
